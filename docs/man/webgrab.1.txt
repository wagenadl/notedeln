WEBGRAB(1)

NAME
----
webgrab - Capture a snapshot of a web page

SYNOPSIS
--------
*webgrab* ['OPTIONS'] 'URL' 'OUTFILE' [...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*webgrab* loads a page from the web (specified by 'URL') and renders
it to a local file. The format of the file is determined from its file
name. Currently, pdf, jpg, png, and many other bitmap file formats are
supported in Linux, while only pdf is supported on Mac and
Windows. This discrepancy will be addressed once Qt's QWebEngine
technology matures.

OPTIONS
-------

*-p*::
    Specifies that output should be split into pages. (Valid for pdf
    output only.)

*-t, -s, -m, -l, -h*::
    Specifies that output images should be __t__iny, __s__mall, __m__edium,
    __l__arge, or __h__uge, which is to say 160, 320, 640, 1280, or 2560
    pixels wide.

BUGS
----
There may be bugs. Please contact the author if one bites you.
