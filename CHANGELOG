  -- Daniel A. Wagenaar <daw@caltech.edu>  Fri, 10 Nov 2017 22:07:21 -0800

eln 1.2.8

  No more.

  -- Daniel A. Wagenaar <daw@caltech.edu>  Wed, 04 Oct 2017 17:03:39 -0700

eln 1.2.7

  Working on pbuilder compatibility

  -- Daniel A. Wagenaar <daw@caltech.edu>  Fri, 29 Sep 2017 19:46:06 -0700

eln 1.2.6

  Now can use 0x1xxxx Unicode characters.
  Now using bold italic greek which looks much better with Ubuntu font
  Fixed, crudely, presumably longstanding bug that crashed when TextBlockItem::sizeToFit was called from GfxNoteItem/LateNoteItem::updateTextPos before the TBI had its fragments created.
  CloneDialog now correctly returns clone location.
  Now italicizes “et al.”, “in vivo”, “de novo” etc. as a unit
  Fixed x_i -> ξ bug
  Deletion of empty text blocks between gfxblocks now works. Likewise, creating a text block between adjacent gfxblocks now works
  Fixed longstanding bug re image moving. Now a change of "yref" causes GfxBlockItem to emit heightChanges so that a restack follows.
  GfxBlockItem now correctly resizes when GfxNoteItem changes
  Fixed longstanding bug: Crash when empty GfxNote is deleted with Ctrl-Delete

  -- Daniel A. Wagenaar <daw@caltech.edu>  Thu, 28 Sep 2017 20:45:37 -0700

eln 1.2.4

  Drag and drop now works to paste images below text.
  Downloading with http redirection works again.
  Minor hack to TextItem to prevent clipping in case of font metric
  inconsistencies between different computers.

  -- Daniel A. Wagenaar <daw@caltech.edu>  Thu, 01 Jun 2017 11:46:30 -0700

eln 1.2.2

  * Bugfix to Resource::safeName that caused Windows version to not paste images
  * Shift + Movement keys no longer jumps to next paragraph by way of the
    futilemovement mechanism, so selection does not get undesirably lost.
  * GfxNoteItem can now be dragged by the line
  * Got rid of temporary move mode. Movement now with Control. User guide updated
  * Fixed bug: Notebook no longer load()s upon construction. That is important,
    because otherwise git update happened _after_ checking TOC
  * Ctrl-Enter continues paragraph.
  * Improvements to mathmode text entering: I'll, can't, a, I now work directly.
    v <Ctrl-Slash> no longer makes arrow down. <partial> now correct.
  * Trivial bugfix to windeploy
  * Minor bugfix to innoscript

  -- Daniel A. Wagenaar <daw@caltech.edu>  Tue, 18 Apr 2017 13:21:58 -0700

eln 1.2.0

  This is the first release of ELN in nearly a year that includes
  versions for Mac, Windows, as well as Linux.
  ELN has been largely feature-complete, so mostly this is a bug-fix
  release.
  The most major improvement is probably that resolving URL references
  now works on Windows.

  -- Daniel A. Wagenaar <daw@caltech.edu>  Thu, 19 Jan 2017 17:13:30 -0800

eln 1.1.16

  * https links now work in windows, for PubMed autonotes and URL references.
  * AutoNote now uses Downloader
  * Improved release system
  * Fixed eln.desktop to contain %f
  * Docs now built in shadow dir.

  -- Daniel A. Wagenaar <daw@caltech.edu>  Wed, 18 Jan 2017 21:01:00 -0800

eln 1.1.11

  User visible changes

  * Webgrab modified to work with QWebEngine on Windows and Mac. Sadly, I cannot get preview images, since QWebEngine will only save as pdf, and Qt does not have a native pdf renderer. So, the current version creates a fake preview that just has the window title.
  * Fixed bug in Downloader that caused crash on error
  * Latenotes and gfx notes now included in search index
  * Page links now work for single-digit pages
  * Removed disused magic links
  * Ctrl-Shift click on link text now works again and does not try to move note.
  * GfxNoteItem no longer grabs mouse in 1000-pix-wide box if width is unlimited
  * Now displays proper error if trying to load non-notebook.
  * Underlining restored
  * Command to remove sub/superscripts now on Control+Semicolon.
  * Ancient bug fixed in TableItem that caused crash when deleting empty cells as part of a selection
  * Fixed bad spacing in tables due to Qt5 mismeasuring newlines in font metrics
  * Minor changes to dialogs for hi-dpi
  * Shift+Control+Drag fix for move/resize images
  * Mode shift now triggered by Shift+Ctrl rather than Alt
  * New entry ("+") button always visible
  * Bugfix to navigation bar help balloons not disappearing
  * Webgrab now calculates better bboxes
  * Added goto page dialog on Ctrl-G
  * The TOC button now goes to TOC sheet for current entry.
  * Longstanding bug fixed: superscripting in tables now works

  Implementation changes

  * EntryData::resManager no longer pretends it can work with this==0.
  * GfxNoteItem no longer sets its width if readonly
  * temporaryOverride no longer overrides movement
  * Changed author email address
  * Now uses qt5 in Linux
  * Fixed bug where Delete failed when itemAt somehow did not return a sketch item even though the glow was still on it. Used a bit of a hack: storing a "glow item" pointer with each item.
  * Created '-nocui' option to circumvent computer ID checking. Fixed long-standing bug in CUI recycling implementation. Made CUI independent of user home directory date stamp, because I found that logging out and back in reset that date stamp.

eln 1.1.8

  Very minor changes:

  Figure space now needs Ctrl+Shift+Space
  PrintDialog no longer opens created pdf by default
  Change code "in" to "inset"
  F11 toggles fullscreen
  Slight improvement to Assert and CrashReport. Crash box now includes ELN version number
  Moved the debian building tools to separate repository

  -- Daniel A. Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Mon, 09 May 2016 14:43:54 -0400

eln 1.1.7

  Trivial change to build process

  -- Daniel A. Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Fri, 08 Apr 2016 12:14:13 -0400

eln 1.1.6

  User visible changes:

  Improved footnote handling. Using symbols as footnote markers creates
  automatic superscripts. Bug related to overlapping footnote references
  fixed.

  Bugfix: Markups in table preserved when inserting/deleting rows/columns.

  Slight improvements in navigation icons and behavior.

  Dead links are shown in red.

  Webgrab limits aspect ratio of preview.

  Other changes:

  The files toc.json and index.json are no longer maintained in git. Rather,
  they are locally updated. A ".gitignore" file is generated automatically.

  Several bugs figxed.

  -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Fri, 08 Apr 2016 09:52:19 -0400

eln 1.1.4

  User-visible changes:

  * Icon bars now hide when mouse leaves window. This fixes the bugs relating to per-view mode settings.

  * Ctrl-Period now restores inadvertent super/subscript.

  Implementation changes:

  * Indexing overhauled. Now much more reliable.

  * BookData no longer uses or updates endDate. FrontScene uses TOC to calculate endDate. This means that book.eln will no longer cause merge conflicts.

  Bugs fixed:

  * Tables cannot be split across sheets, but navigation bugs fixed. Central problem was that handleSheetRequest did not get connected for TableBlocks.

  * Fixes to Assert and CrashReport: Assert::crash now actual quits the application. CrashReport does not fork for Debug version: forking kept gdb from working right.
  * Mode is now part of Notebook
  * LateNotes now create their own ResManagers
  * Bugfix to gotoEntryPage by UUID. Improvements to new event view code.
  * Entirely new approach to event views. Works better.
  * Added "-novc" flag to disable VC for debugging purposes
  * All dialogs now use Translate for "eln"; Assertions cleaned up; CrashReport now actually works (at least in Linux).
  * Now includes build date in version number if minor is odd

  -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Wed, 16 Dec 2015 08:39:33 -0500

eln 1.1.0

  User visible changes:

      SplashScene now works much better at HiDPI

      Navbar hides >> and >| on last page; > is replaced by +. TOC icon now goes to last page of TOC.

      EntryData now reports when it becomes empty or nonempty. This allows greying/enabling the "+" icon in Navbar.

      New context menu on hyperlinks

      Slight refinement to note positioning for small notes

      Rebuilding TOC automatically renumbers as needed

      Modifying an entry on a computer other than the one on which it was made is no longer allowed, except for adding "late notes".

      Added a clock face when ELN is full screen.

      "Create new notebook" and "Load existing notebook" dialogs now open with better default folder locations.

  Internal improvements:

      "Late notes" are now stored in a separate file to reduce the risk of merge conflicts. The only incompatibility this causes between old and new files and old and new versions of ELN is that old versions of ELN will not display the new-style notes.

      Page links are now internally enhanced with a UUID to render them
      immune to renumbering.

      Now converts filename on command line from Windows style as needed.

      Several trivial changes to make ELN compile on Android. User interface still leaves a lot to be desired: ELN is clearly not an "app".

  Bugs fixed:

      Footnotes can now be added to secondary sheets of a paragraph. If a footnote is connected to multiple tags, it may appear on any sheet. (That is, it is not automatically moved to the first sheet.) If one tag of a multiply tagged footnote is removed, the footnote is no longer deleted, and it is moved to the appropriate sheet. Unchanged correct behaviors: If a paragraph with multiply tagged footnotes is split, the footnote is copied to both blocks. And if merging blocks results in multiply tagged footnotes, the notes are combined. (If the texts of the notes differ, they are simply concatenated.)

      Navbar visibility now correctly updated when moving to front matter. When shift-clicking on Navbar, correct window now jumps.

      Blockdateitems were slightly shifted below first line of block. No more.
  SplashScene now works much better at HiDPI

      Initial placement of freshly loaded notes now correct

  -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Mon, 23 Nov 2015 09:02:22 -0800

eln 1.0.4

  Several bugfixes:

  * Footnotes now get placed in correct order, even from split paragraphs. Footnotes now get placed on correct sheet, even from split paragrahs and when first visiting entry.
  * Fixed positioning bug for continuation notes
  * I think I got the bug fixed where handleSheetRequest worked in more than one pageview
  * Click in bottom margin once again creates new paragraph
  * TextItem and TextBlockItem now correctly deal with Ctrl-Tab on secondary fragment
  * Added username field to Clone/New dialogs

  -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Fri, 18 Sep 2015 15:01:18 -0400

eln 1.0.2

  * Added GPL text
  * git test now quiet
  * Selection across sheets now works
  * Appling simple styles (e.g., italic) now works with combining diacritics
  * Fixed bug with script styles and combining marks.
  * Rearranged toolitems slightly
  * Added Help button and simple help text.
  * Better spacing in toolbars
  * Removed Goodfish font from icons, now using Ubuntu instead, which is the font used in the rest of the notebook. Goodfish looked baroque in the icons.
  * Mathmode no longer inserts thin space as italic correction nor removes them.
  * An empty first page is now deleted upon abandonment just like any other empty page. Abandonment of empty pages is also triggered when the PageView is closed. If an empty page somehow survives (e.g., due to crash), it is redated when next loaded. (This is important, because otherwise an old empty page at the end of a notebook makes it impossible to create new pages.) When the TOC is empty, it is skipped by nextPage(). (Not by previousPage(), because abandonment has not been responded to when previousPage() is called.)
  * BackgroundVC no longer complains when vc=""
  * Made cursor navigation treat char+combining diacritical as one
  * Replaced Q_ASSERT by ASSERT
  * Added TeX code bar for overbar
  * Improved assertion messages
  * Better crash reporting on segfault
  * Cleaned up assertion implementation
  * Better make install

  -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Wed, 09 Sep 2015 08:05:10 -0400

eln 1.0.0

  Finally ready for a 1.0 release. Relatively minor changes since 0.10.2:

  - Improved splash screen with better dialogs that allow setting up git
    archives.

  - Improved front scene that makes it clearer what the editable items are.

  - Many bug fixes

  -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Mon, 24 Aug 2015 15:58:59 -0400

eln 0.10.2

  -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Mon, 22 Jun 2015 14:07:00 -0400

eln 0.9.1

  Windows only bugfix release

  * Windows font rendering was always rather ugly due to to horizontal
    hinting which caused very irregular letter spacing.
    By switching to Qt 5.4.2 and forcing freetype font rendering, this
    problem has been solved.

  -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Tue, 09 Jun 2015 09:11:25 -0400

eln 0.9.0

  New in this version:

  * Improved support for tables
    - Multicellular cut-and-paste
    - Cleaned up user interface for creating/deleting tables/rows/columns

  * Improved cut and paste support
    - Cut-and-paste within eln now copies basic styles along.
      - Currently, that applies to bold, italic, and super- and subscript.
      - Other markups like strikethrough are not yet supported.
      - Footnotes are not yet copied.
    - Copying between eln and other applications now tries to maintain
      basic styles (bold, italic, super- and subscript) by importing and
      exporting corresponding html tags.

  * Completely overhauled the rendering engine for text
    - Fewer surprises of line spacing changes
    - Immunity against subtle differences between font metrics on different
      machines
    - Regrettably, there is not currently an Undo mechanism. (But this used
      to be somewhat buggy, so it may not be a great loss.)

  * New support for automatic footnotes for Pubmed IDs
    - Just type the numeric Pubmed ID, hit Ctrl-N to create a footnote, and
      ELN will reach out to Pubmed to retrieve the citation information.

  * Many bugfixes

  -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Mon, 08 Jun 2015 10:28:44 -0400

eln 0.6.1

  * Now uses custom TextItem for all text rendering except on front page.
    This makes us more immune to font changes.

  * Release tools for debian now complete.
