WEBGRAB(1)

NAME
----
webgrab - Capture a snapshot of a web page

SYNOPSIS
--------
*webgrab* ['OPTIONS'] 'URL' 'OUTFILE' [...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*webgrab* loads a page from the web (specified by 'URL') and renders it to a
local file. The format of the file is determined from its file name. Currently,
pdf, jpg, png, and many other bitmap file formats are supported in Linux,
while only pdf is supported on Mac and Windows. This discrepancy will be
addressed once Qt's QWebEngine technology matures.

OPTIONS
-------

*-p*::
    Specifies that output should be paginated. (Valid for pdf output only.)

*-t, -s, -m, -l, -h*::
    Specifies that output images should be __t__iny, __s__mall, __m__edium,
    __l__arge, or __h__uge, which is to say 160, 320, 640, 1280, or 2560
    pixels wide.

BUGS
----
There may be bugs. Please contact the author if one bites you.
